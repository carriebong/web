  <br><br>Every ginger cat is unique, but because they all carry the tabby gene, they have certain characteristics in common. For example, all tabbies have a distinctive M-shaped marking on their foreheads. The rest of their patterning is determined by genetics.</p>
  <p>Most ginger cats also have an even temperament, like people, are typically affectionate, and are usually less shy and more friendly than your average house cat.</p>
  <p style="margin-top:60px;">Abyssinians are a playful breed which can come in a stunning range of red hues, including: ruddy, sorrel and fawn. These ginger cats are known to be super smart so they'll need plenty of entertaining.</p>
